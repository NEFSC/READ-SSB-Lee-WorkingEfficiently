# Introduction
This repository is simply a collection of other repositories that are designed to help you work more efficiently, plus a "how to help" section.

# How to help 

Please help make these more valuable and keep them up-to-date.  To add your knowledge:
1.   [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) - It's in the top right of github.  ![Here's a picture](/images/fork_edit.jpg)
1.   Make your changes  - click the file you want to edit and then the little pencil on the right side.  Don't forget to use the preview button if you're using the web editor. ![Here's a picture](/images/editor_preview.jpg)
1.   Issue a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) so the changes get into the document.  It's a good idea to request a review so the maintainer knows that they need to review and commit.

To just keep tabs on a repository for changes, you can watch it. ![Here's a picture](/images/watch.png)
